                    <h3>Education Meets Fun</h3>
                    <p>Designed by a team of passionate educators and game developers, "The Hunt For Knowledge" reimagines traditional learning as an adventure game that takes students through different time periods.</p>
                    <p>Players work together in pairs, answer curriculum-aligned questions, and defeat knowledge-based bosses to progress. One student controls movement (A and D keys) while the other handles actions (SPACE and LEFT MOUSE), creating an environment that focuses on communication and teamwork.</p>
                    <p>Our innovative 3D-printed wand controllers immerse students in the experience, making them feel like wizards of knowledge as they journey through the annals of history!</p>

                        <h3>Two-Player Collaboration</h3>
                        <p>Our innovative control system splits responsibilities between two students:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Player 1 controls movement (A and D keys)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>This design naturally encourages verbal communication, planning, and teamwork. Students must coordinate their actions to navigate obstacles and solve puzzles, developing vital collaboration skills.</p>

                        <p>To perform special actions in the game, students must correctly answer curriculum-aligned questions. These questions can be customized by teachers to match exactly what's being taught in class.</p>
                        <p>Correct answers unlock abilities like jumping over obstacles, opening doors, or activating special powers - turning knowledge into in-game progress.</p>

                        <p>At key moments, the game transitions to exciting first-person boss battles inspired by classic RPGs. These knowledge showdowns test what students have learned throughout their adventure.</p>
                        <p>During boss battles, players must answer increasingly challenging questions to defeat historical figures or scientific concepts brought to life as game characters. The turn-based system gives students time to think and discuss before answering.</p>
